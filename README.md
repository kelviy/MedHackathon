# MedHackathon
The repository contains the code for our team's submission in the Harvard Health System's Hackathon @ Cape Town Hub. 
Our team attempted to use an AI model to predict respiratory diseases from audio data. The audio data was gathered from publicly available datasets from Kaggle, Github and other sources. For our AI model, we used an RENE model architecture detailed in this paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07442). We fine-tuned the pretrained model that was provided by the authors of the RENE (https://github.com/zpforlove/Rene).

Many thanks to the organisers of the event!
